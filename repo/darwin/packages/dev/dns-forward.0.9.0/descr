DNS resolution and forwarding

A library to help the construction of DNS resolvers or forwarding servers.
Given a configuration which names upstream resolvers and policy (e.g. only
use these servers for names within this domain), allow the creation of
Resolvers which answer DNS questions and of forwarding servers which listen
for requests and forward them appropriately.
